A connected devices operator provides internet services for a private provider. 
They operate a large number of connected network equipment.  
Each equipment has two or sub-modules. 
The failure of one submodule may impact a device and interrupt the service. 
The devices collect telemetry every five seconds and send it to a local server and the cloud. 

The logs are JSON files, and based on the firmware/software versions, 
the log message of business as usual and early signs of failure and failures are different. 
The team is looking to implement an AI-enabled early detection and healing solution.

Notes:
There is no labeled data available. The team is thinking of jump-starting with unsupervised learning.
