### A social networking platform is extending its capability with Artificial Intelligence. The product owner is looking for the following features:
- Based on the user's past content, professional profile, and interactions with content, we recommend sharing professionally written and published third-party content. 
- While sharing the content, the user should be able to get a summary matching the writing style with hashtags. 
- Based on the user's input topic trends, the platform observed for the day provides content writing ideas. Based on the user's selections, provide AI-generated content drafts and editsâ€”remember to adopt the user's writing style. 
- Guide the user about the suitable time of the day to publish the content so that the user receives audience engagement. 
- Build an end-to-end system to track the success of the feature from users' perspective and product managers' perspectives.
